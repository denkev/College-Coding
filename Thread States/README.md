*THIS CODE IS A DEMONSTRATION FOR AN ACTIVITY IN COLLEGE*

This code aims to show users how do Thread States work, what are they, and what is the inner workings of the changing of states.

It creates a thread that simulates work. 
Depending on the user input, it either asks for an input that controls the state of a thread in a continuous loop
Or it will simulate work that shows us the states of the created thread during and after simulating work.

*HOW TO COMPILE*

Using an online compiler, here are the steps to compile the code:
1. Copy the entirety of the code.
2. Paste it in the online compiler.
3. Specify that the language used is java.
4. Declare the file name with the same name as its Class (In this case, rename it to ThreadStates.java).
5. Run it.

Using an IDE, here are the steps to compile:
1. Make sure the prerequisites to run java is installed in the system, especially on IDE's like VSCode or NETBeans.
2. Download the source code file.
3. Open the file in the IDE.
4. Run the code.

Using Windows POWERSHELL or Command Prompt, here is how you compile my code:
1. Download my source code file and save it in Desktop so that we could find it easily.
2. Type in the terminal of Powershell the following: "cd Desktop".
3. Afterwards, "javac ThreadStates.java".
4. Finally, run the code using the command "java Threadstates".
