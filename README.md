Welcome to my Repository! Here is where I store my codes from the entirety of my college journey.

What are the things that are contained in this file?
I have numerous source codes of activities that I have done from my 1st year in college until my current year.

You can view my activities' codes inside this repository.
But excuse me, Mr. Moser, how can I view the output of your code?

Easy, just follow the steps I'll give you:

*COMPILING CODE USING AN ONLINE COMPILER*
1. Access the online compiler
2. View a source code from my repository
3. Copy the entirety of the code
4. Paste it into the online compiler
5. Choose the appropriate coding language of the code you chose (it's on the upper right corner of the site)
6. SITUATIONAL, JAVA ONLY: Declare the code you're running in the same name of the class of the copied code

3. View a source code from my repository
4. Download the file that you want to view
5. Save it to Desktop in order to easily find it later on
6. Open the file in the IDE
7. Similarly, if the code you copied is using java language, rename the file of the code to the same name of your class
8. Run it.

*COMPILING CODE USING POWERSHELL/CMD*
